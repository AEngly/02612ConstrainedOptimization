2.1 
	- Optimal control problem generator
	- Portfolio optimization problem generator
	- Huber fitting problem generator (think it is correct)
	- Support vector machine random problem generator
2.5 
    - Equality constraints must be fixed
    - find feasible initial point(seems to work)
    - repair primal active set
    - test correctness
        - find test problem from book or exercises
    - benchmark
    - remove linprog from initial point
    - fill variables if itermax is hit
2.6
    - test correctness
    - update stopping criterias
    - benchmark


Questions:

What should the QT be for the optimal control problem?
